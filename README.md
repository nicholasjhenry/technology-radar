it just contanins dummy data. The content below is current, however._

## About the rings

Adopted quadrants are listed below under each heading. Other rings are managed as GitHub issues.

- [Assess](https://github.com/nicholasjhenry/technology-radar/issues?q=label%3Aring%3Aassess): These items I am currently exploring with the goal to understand the impact on client projects.
  It's possible they will live in assess
- [Trial](https://github.com/nicholasjhenry/technology-radar/issues?q=label%3Aring%3Atrial): These items I am currently trying on a personal or professional project.
- __Adopt__: These items I have adopted into my personal toolbox.
- [Hold](https://github.com/nicholasjhenry/technology-radar/issues?q=label%3Aring%3Ahold): These items I have assessed, trialed or adopted previously but are no longer used.
