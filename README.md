### Adopt

These items I have adopted into my personal toolbox.

_See quandrants below._

### Trial

These items I am currently trying on a personal or professional project.

_None currently._

### Assess

These items I am currently exploring with the goal to understand the impact.

- [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io) (K8s): an open-source system for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.
- [Graphana](https://grafana.com): allows you to query, visualize, alert on and understand your metrics no matter where they are stored. Create, explore, and share dashboards with your team and foster a data driven culture.
- [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io): power your metrics and alerting with a leading open-source monitoring solution.
- [Telemetry](https://github.com/beam-telemetry/telemetry): dynamic dispatching library for metrics and instrumentations.
- [Broadway](https://hexdocs.pm/broadway): a concurrent, multi-stage tool for building data ingestion and data processing pipelines.

### Hold

These items I would proceed with caution. I don't currently track those.
