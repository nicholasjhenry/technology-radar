# Technology Radar

My opinionated guide to technology using the [ThoughtWorks](https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar) template.

_Status: The link http://thght.works/3er4yux populated with `data.csv` has not be fully implemented yet,
it just contanins dummy data. The content below is current, however._

About the rings:

- __Assess__: These items I am currently exploring with the goal to understand the impact on client projects.
  It's possible they will live in assess
- __Trial__: These items I am currently trying on a personal or professional project.
- __Adopt__: These items I have adopted into my personal toolbox.
- __Hold__: These items I have assessed, trialed or adopted previously but are no longer used.
